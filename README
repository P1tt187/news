# Spirit-News is a simple blogging system for the Faculty of Computer Science of the University of Applied Sciences Schmalkalden!

First lines of code were produced by students during a course on functional programming by Professor Braun.
Professor Braun is always seeking for students to improve code and functionality in this open source project!

Features:
* Auth against internal university LDAP Server
* Using Lift 2.1 with Scala 2.8.0 and MongoDB
* News will be directly posted on Twitter and Facebook
* Students can be notified via mailinglists
* lots more.....

In the future it is planned to create a plattform for students, where
they can log in, read news ( which is possible now ) and manage their
schedule and hopefully a lot more!

NOTICE: This code works with a MongoDB installation, but a login only works inside of the campus network since auth only works
with the internal LDAP Server.

To run it you will need a working installation of the Simple Build Tool. http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/

We know there is lots of room for improvement on the code. But most people working on it just started
with real world programming, so don't be to hard on us ;)!

Ideas, friendly critisism and bugs are always welcomed!
